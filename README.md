# coronavirus_tweet_sentiment_analysis

# OBJECTIVE
Sentiment analysis on tweets related to the coronavirus (COVID-19) can be useful for understanding public opinion, tracking trends, and identifying potential areas of concern. In this task, we can use machine learning techniques, such as logistic regression or support vector machines, to predict the sentiment of a given tweet as positive, negative, or neutral.

# INTRODUCTION

# DATASET
Coronavirus Tweet Sentiment analysis dataset comprises of 41156 records which has 6 columns namely 'Location', 'Tweet At', 'Original Tweet', 'Sentiment','User name','Screen name'. In between 'Sentiment' column which tells about the inclination of the tweet in terms of 'positive', 'negetive', 'extremely positive','extremely negative'.
